This is a simple note program for recording daily schedules. It has five main functions:
1. read all notes: it will print out all your daily schedules on the screen.
2.add a new item: This function allows users to add a new item at the end of the note
3.rewrite the specified note: This function allows users to rewrite a specified item in the file.
4.Delete the specified item: This function allows users to delete a specified item in the file.
5. Create a new .txt file at specified path.
*When the user creates a new note file, the date will be automatically added to the first line of the file.
Because I think date can make this note program look more professional.XD

It will create a writable file and print the date of creation on the first line of the file

and traverse each line of the file through the headlines() function
In order for the user to see how many lines of content there are,
